# Montager - montage composition generator

Originally I've used a manual approach to create montages for our walls; the process was not just time consuming - but it left quite a lot of space unused between the pieces

This project was created to make the process easier and possibly create better montages - with more space-effective layouts and possibly more interesting borders between the images.

This is my first Rust project as well - and as such it may contain misuses of the language/etc :D

testrun1:	8000x5000	~30 image

testrun2; +dist_queue
